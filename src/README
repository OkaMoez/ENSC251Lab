# ENSC251Lab
Brigham Okano's ENSC251 Summer 2019 Semester Lab Project

A student information database with features added throught the course.
Also an opportunity to learn to use git.

------------------
Lab 1 Requirements [COMPLETE] [9/10]
------------------
1. Student class [COMPLETE]
2. DomesticStudent class [COMPLETE]
3. InternationalStudent class [COMPLETE]
4. ToelfScore class [COMPLETE]
5. getter/setters [COMPLETE]
5. .hpp/.cpp separation [COMPLETE]
6. unit test [COMPLETE]

Note: Lost Marks
0.5 - didn't complile on server, error with "nullptr"
    *** Using NULL results in no complile errors
    Fixed.
0.5 - used inheritance instead of getters/setters to link ToelfScore to students
    Fixed.
Forgot some out-of-place code (vectors, blank fields, etc)
    Cleaned in Lab_2 [20/06/2019]

------------------
Lab 2 Requirements [COMPLETE] [10/10]
------------------
1. Implement arrays/vectors [COMPLETE]
2. Comparator functions [COMPLETE]
3. Overload << opperator [COMPLETE]
4. Sort based on user input, single field [COMPLETE]
5. Overall sort (C then R then Local, min Toelf) [COMPLETE]
6. Unit test [COMPLETE]
7. Comments [COMPLETE]

Note: Feedback
 - Make sure to thouroughly comment things not learnt in class
Using Templates to handle differing vector inputs, but lots of repeats
    Maybe look for a cleaner way of handling ~10x repeated templates
    Am using overloaded function and consolidating functions
    Maybe look into polymorphism and unions?

------------------
Lab 3 Requirements [COMPLETE] [8.5/10]
------------------
1. Linked list [COMPLETE]
2. Sorting input [COMPLETE]
3. Search matching fields [COMPLETE]
4. Insert new student sorted [COMPLETE]
5. Delete students [COMPLETE]
6. Merge lists [COMPLETE]
7. Rewrite sorting functions [COMPLETE]
8. Comments [COMPLETE]

Note: Lost Marks
1 - Couldn't merge at time of submition
    Fixed pointers and removed use of references except to compare
    Fixed.
0.5 - Could not demonstrate sorting once merged
    Fixed.
